# 3d-cube
**Newest Version at this link https://www.shadertoy.com/view/DtyBzt** better performance and more accurate shapes. Lighting looks less good however.

This is a 3d renderer I made using GLSL

**New Version**: Made in Shader Toy --> changed up the math to use linear algebra instead of ray maching. Lines are shaper but the variety of shapes is less. Runs faster

**Old Version**: Made in GLSL Sandbox --> ray marching technique kinda. Able to render a whole host of shapes but the distance from the camera you can see is limited.
